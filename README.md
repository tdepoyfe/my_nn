# my_nn
Implementation of a neural net in C++; can handle dense networks of arbitrary number of neurons with arbitrary number of layers,
for classification or for regression problems.

The interface is still rough, the underlying data storage and computations can be improved, and I still have to implement 
more tests, batch training and evaluation, and benchmarks.
